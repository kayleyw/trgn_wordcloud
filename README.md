# trgn_wordcloud## About the appThis app was created to summarizing a (2+) series of webpages and generate wordcloud image on a webpage once per day. ## Installation & Usage### CloneFirst, you need to use [git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) to clone this repository to your local machine: `$ git clone https://github.com/kayleyw/trgn_wordcloud`### InstallationThis app uses [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html) to scrape contents from a list of websites. Make sure you have installed wget before running this app. `$ brew install wget`This app uses the python scrip [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text) to convert html files to text files. You can install the python script html2text like this:```$ cd ~/bin $ git clone https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text $ cd html2text$ mv html2text ~/bin/.```The word cloud image is created by the python script [wordcloud](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud). You can install the program to your `~/bin/` like this: ```$ cd ~/bin$ git clone https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud.git$ cd word_cloud```You may get an error when running this program if you didn't install this program locally.

Make sure you have a world readable directory `~/public_html` on your server (you may need to contact your server administrator for this). You can create a html file in this directory to put your wordcloud image on a webpage. This is an example of the html file I created: ```<!doctype html><html lang="en"><head>  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">  <style>      body {font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; }  </style>  <meta charset="utf-8">  <title>COVID-19 Vaccines Development Updates</title></head><body><h1> Daily COVID-19 Vaccines Devlopment Updates</h1><p>Hello!
