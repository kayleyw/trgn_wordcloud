Researchers around the world are racing to develop a vaccine against Covid-19,
with [more than 170 candidate vaccines now
tracked](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19
-candidate-vaccines) by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Vaccines normally require years of testing and additional time to produce at
scale, but scientists are hoping to develop a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to
18 months.

Vaccines mimic the virus – or part of the virus – they protect against,
stimulating the immune system to develop antibodies. They must follow higher
safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of
healthy people.

## Recent vaccine news

AstraZeneca has [started
trials](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/25/astrazeneca-covid-19
-antibody-drug-trial-volunteers-vaccine) for a drug which could work as a
preventative option for healthy people or slow the disease’s progression in
those who are already infected.

Russian health authorities [have
approved](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/aug/11/coronavirus-live-
news-who-chief-says-its-never-too-late-to-turn-outbreak-around-as-cases-near-
20m?page=with:block-5f3262f58f08da3d1603a315#block-5f3262f58f08da3d1603a315) a
coronavirus vaccine which has yet to complete clinical trials.

## How are vaccines tested?

In the **pre-clinical stage** of testing, researchers give the vaccine to
animals to see if it triggers an immune response.

In **phase 1** of clinical testing, the vaccine is given to a small group of
people to determine whether it is safe and to learn more about the immune
response it provokes.

In **phase 2**, the vaccine is given to hundreds of people so scientists can
learn more about its safety and correct dosage.

In **phase 3**, the vaccine is given to thousands of people to confirm its
safety – including rare side effects – and effectiveness. These trials involve
a control group which is given a placebo.

## Vaccines in clinical trials

### Phase in progress

### Phase completed

University of Oxford/AstraZeneca

The University of Oxford vaccine is delivered via a chimpanzee virus, called
the vaccine vector. The vector contains the genetic code of the protein spikes
found on the coronavirus and triggers a strong immune response in the human
body. The vaccine is in a combined phase 2/3 trial in the UK and [has recently
gone into phase 3 trials in South Africa and
Brazil](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-06-28-trial-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-
starts-brazil).

BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer

Wuhan Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm

Moderna/NIAID

American biotech company Moderna is developing a vaccine candidate using
messenger RNA (or mRNA for short) to trick the body into producing viral
proteins itself. No mRNA vaccine has ever been approved for an infectious
disease, and Moderna [has never brought a product to
market](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/01/us/coronavirus-moderna-vaccine-
invs/index.html). But proponents of the vaccine say it could be easier to mass
produce than traditional vaccines.

Sinovac

Chinese company Sinovac is developing a vaccine based on inactivated Covid-19
particles. The vaccine has shown a promising safety profile in the early
stages of testing and is now moving into Phase 3 trials in Brazil.

The Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Australia is conducting a phase 3
trial using a nearly 100-year-old tuberculosis vaccine. The vaccine is not
thought to protect directly against Covid-19 but might boost the body’s non-
specific immune response.
